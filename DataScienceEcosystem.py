# # Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

# __Objectives:__
# * List popular languages that Data Scientists
# * List commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists
# * Create a single column table
# * Execute some arithmetic expression

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# 1. Python
# 2. R
# 3. Julia
# 4. Scala

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 1. Pandas
# 2. Numpy
# 3. Matplotlib
# 4. SciKit-Learn
# 5. Keras

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# In[1]:


# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
(3*4)+5


# In[2]:


#This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
hours
